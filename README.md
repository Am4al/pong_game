## Overview
The **Pong Game** is a Python implementation of the classic arcade game. This project features a graphical user interface (GUI) where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth across the screen. The game is designed to be a fun, competitive experience with simple controls.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Enjoy the classic Pong game with a clean and user-friendly graphical interface.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend, with Player 1 and Player 2 having their own control schemes.
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive controls using the keyboard for precise paddle movement.
- **Score Tracking**: Each player’s score is tracked as they compete to keep the ball in play.

## Controls
- **Player 1**:
  - Use the **Up Arrow** (`↑`) to move the paddle up.
  - Use the **Down Arrow** (`↓`) to move the paddle down.
  
- **Player 2**:
  - Use the **W** key to move the paddle up.
  - Use the **S** key to move the paddle down.

## How It Works
1. **Game Start**:
   - Run the Python program to launch the game. The paddles appear on either side of the screen with the ball in the center.

2. **Playing the Game**:
   - Players use their respective controls to move their paddles up and down, preventing the ball from passing their side of the screen.
   - The ball bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the game area.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Each time a player misses the ball, the opposing player scores a point. The game continues until one player reaches the winning score or you decide to stop.
